# 1. Load the datasets (assuming they are in the current working directory)
games <- read.csv("games.csv")
players <- read.csv("players.csv")
test_data <- read.csv("test.csv")

# 2. Inspect the first few rows to ensure the data is loaded correctly
head(games)
head(players)
head(test_data)

# 3. Verify column names in the 'players' dataset
colnames(players)

# 4. Aggregate player statistics (e.g., overall_rating, potential) for home and away players
# Check if the column 'player_id' exists or needs adjustment
players_summary <- players %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  summarise(
    overall_rating = mean(overall_rating, na.rm = TRUE),
    potential = mean(potential, na.rm = TRUE),
    crossing = mean(crossing, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# 5. Merge the aggregated player statistics with the games dataset
# Join statistics for home and away teams (repeat for all 11 players if needed)
games <- games %>%
  left_join(players_summary, by = c("home_player_1" = "player_id")) %>%
  rename(home_player_1_rating = overall_rating)

# Repeat for all players (home_player_2, home_player_3, ..., away_player_1, etc.)
# This example only shows for home_player_1, repeat this process for other players.

# 6. Create additional features such as average team ratings and home advantage
games <- games %>%
  mutate(
    avg_home_rating = rowMeans(select(., starts_with("home_player")), na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_away_rating = rowMeans(select(., starts_with("away_player")), na.rm = TRUE),
    home_advantage = 1  # Assuming the home team has an advantage
  )

# 7. Prepare training data: Define the outcome (winner) and relevant features for prediction
train_data <- games %>%
  select(avg_home_rating, avg_away_rating, home_advantage, home_team_goal, away_team_goal)

train_data$winner <- ifelse(train_data$home_team_goal > train_data$away_team_goal, 1, 0)  # Home team wins

# 8. Train a Random Forest model to predict the winner
winner_model <- randomForest(winner ~ avg_home_rating + avg_away_rating + home_advantage,
                             data = train_data, importance = TRUE)

# Print the model to check performance
print(winner_model)

# 9. Train a Linear Regression model to predict the win-by margin
train_data$win_by <- abs(train_data$home_team_goal - train_data$away_team_goal)  # Win-by margin

winby_model <- lm(win_by ~ avg_home_rating + avg_away_rating + home_advantage, data = train_data)

# Check regression model performance
summary(winby_model)

# 10. Preprocess the test data similarly to training data
test_data <- test_data %>%
  left_join(players_summary, by = c("home_player_1" = "player_id")) %>%
  rename(home_player_1_rating = overall_rating) %>%
  mutate(
    avg_home_rating = rowMeans(select(., starts_with("home_player")), na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_away_rating = rowMeans(select(., starts_with("away_player")), na.rm = TRUE),
    home_advantage = 1  # Assuming home advantage
  )

# 11. Make predictions on the test data
test_data$predicted_winner <- predict(winner_model, test_data)
test_data$predicted_win_by <- predict(winby_model, test_data)

# 12. Prepare the submission file (predicted winner and win-by)
submission <- test_data %>%
  select(predicted_winner, predicted_win_by) %>%
  rename(winner = predicted_winner, winby = predicted_win_by)

# 13. Write the submission file
write.csv(submission, "submission.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Output is saved as submission.csv, which contains predictions for the test set
