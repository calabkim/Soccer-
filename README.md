Soccer Match Outcome Prediction
This project predicts the outcomes of soccer matches and the "win-by" margin (goal difference) using historical match and player data. The models built in this project will be used to predict:

Whether the home team wins or loses (binary classification).
The goal difference (win-by) between the teams (regression).

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the results of soccer matches based on past games and player statistics. The main tasks are to:

Predict if the home team wins or loses.
Predict the goal difference (win-by margin) for the game.
The evaluation is based on:

AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the classification of match outcomes.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for predicting the goal difference.
Data Description
The project uses three CSV files as input:

games.csv: Contains match-level data for soccer matches played from 2008 to 2014.
players.csv: Contains player-level statistics such as rating, potential, and work rate.
test.csv: Contains match data for games played in 2015 and 2016, where the goal is to predict outcomes.
Features:
Home/Away Team IDs: Unique identifiers for home and away teams.
Player IDs: Identifiers for the players in the match.
Player Stats: Aggregated statistics such as overall rating and work rate for players in both teams.
Feature Engineering
We aggregate player-level statistics for each match by combining the players.csv and games.csv data:

Average player rating: Aggregated player ratings for both the home and away teams.
Potential and work rate: Other player-level attributes are aggregated similarly.
Historical performance: Historical averages for goals scored and conceded by teams (optional).
These features are then used in machine learning models for classification and regression.

Modeling Approach
Two models are trained:

Classification: To predict whether the home team wins or loses.
Regression: To predict the win-by margin (goal difference).
Both models are trained using XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm that is highly efficient for both classification and regression tasks.

Model 1: Classification
Task: Predict whether the home team wins or loses.
Model: XGBoost with binary:logistic objective.
Model 2: Regression
Task: Predict the goal difference between teams.
Model: XGBoost with reg:squarederror objective.
How to Run
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/soccer-outcome-prediction.git
cd soccer-outcome-prediction
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the required packages installed. You can install them with the following command:

r
Copy code
install.packages(c("dplyr", "caret", "xgboost"))
3. Run the Code
The following steps outline how to train the models and make predictions:

Train the models:

Open soccer_prediction.R.
Run the script in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
Make predictions:

Predictions for the test.csv dataset will be saved in submission.csv after running the script.
Dependencies
R version 4.x.x or later
R packages:
dplyr: For data manipulation.
caret: For splitting data and evaluating models.
xgboost: For training classification and regression models.
